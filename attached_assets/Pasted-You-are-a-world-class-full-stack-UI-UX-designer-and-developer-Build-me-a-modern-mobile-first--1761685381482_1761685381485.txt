You are a world-class full-stack UI/UX designer and developer.  
Build me a **modern, mobile-first bakery web app** named **Pam_Lee’s Kitchen**, cloned in look, feel, and functionality from **Dis-Chem’s website** — but rebranded for a local bakery.  

🎯 GOAL:
- Build a full-stack, visually stunning, and fast e-commerce web app.
- Include a **welcoming login/signup page** (first page users see).
- After successful login, automatically redirect users to the **homepage**.
- Use elegant visuals, bakery images, and smooth animations.

🏗️ STRUCTURE:
- Login / Signup page
- Homepage (featured items, mission, call-to-action)
- Menu page (filterable products with images & prices)
- Order page (form + payment gateway placeholder)
- Order tracking page
- Specials & promotions page
- Gallery page (images in lightbox)
- Contact page (form + map + social links)
- Admin page (manage orders, products, specials)

🎨 DESIGN SYSTEM:
- Colors: Gold (#D4AF37), Black (#000000), White (#FFFFFF)
- Font pairing: Playfair Display (headings), Poppins (body)
- Style: “Luxury bakery meets modern e-commerce”
- Elements: Buttons with gold hover glow, rounded corners, parallax hero banners
- Include high-quality placeholder bakery images, logos, and icons.

💻 TECH STACK:
- Next.js (App Router) + Tailwind CSS
- Authentication with NextAuth.js (email/password)
- Database: PostgreSQL or Supabase (mock for now)
- Hosting: Vercel
- Use `public/images/` for visuals.

🔄 FUNCTIONAL FLOW:
1️⃣ When user visits site → show login/signup page  
2️⃣ On successful login → redirect to `/home`  
3️⃣ From homepage → navigate to menu, order, etc.  
4️⃣ Include navbar, footer, and consistent design.

🎨 REQUIREMENTS:
- Beautiful hero banner with bakery background.
- Reusable components (Navbar, Footer, ProductCard).
- Responsive (mobile-first).
- Smooth fade-in transitions & hover effects.

🧩 OUTPUT:
- Fully functional Next.js project folder
- Tailwind styling
- Placeholder images for UI
- Auto-redirect from login → home
- Include code snippets and mock data for menu items.
